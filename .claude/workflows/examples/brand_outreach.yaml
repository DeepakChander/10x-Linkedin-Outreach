          no_pitch: true

        notes: |
          Comment should be thoughtful and specific to their content.
          NO mention of your product/service yet.
          Examples:
          - "The lighting in this campaign is incredible - love how it captures the brand essence"

          leave_door_open: true
        purpose: "Professional close"
        notes: |
          Brief, respectful close.
          Example: "Hey! Just wanted to say I'll keep supporting the brand

          make sense down the road, I'm always happy to chat! 🙌"
