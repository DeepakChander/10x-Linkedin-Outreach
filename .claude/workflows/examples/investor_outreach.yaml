    day: 0
    description: "Check for potential warm introductions"
    type: "manual_check"
    steps:
      - action: "check_mutual_connections"
        platform: "linkedin"
        purpose: "Find warm intro path"

          - Portfolio founder connections
          - Event co-attendees

          If warm intro available: PAUSE and pursue that path.

        purpose: "Follow their investment thesis content"

      - action: "like_tweet"
        platform: "twitter"
        delay_before: "2-4 hours"
        target: "investment_thesis_tweets"  # Their takes on investing

          data_backed: true
          no_pitch: true
        purpose: "Demonstrate market knowledge"
        notes: |
          Investors respect founders who understand markets.
          Share a genuine insight, not a pitch.

          in [adjacent space] - [specific data point]"

          Example: "Hi [name], I've been following your thoughts on
          [sector] - particularly your thread on [topic]. Building in
          this space and would value being connected."

# Only after some engagement, send concise email
# =============================================================================

        notes: |
          Investor emails should be:

          - Lead with traction/metrics
          - Clear thesis fit
          - Specific ask (meeting, not "pick your brain")
          - Easy to forward

          Structure:
          1. One-liner on what you do
          2. Key traction metric
          3. Why them specifically (thesis fit)
          4. Clear ask

# =============================================================================

          [new milestone]. Would still love to chat if you have
          15 minutes this week."

# =============================================================================
