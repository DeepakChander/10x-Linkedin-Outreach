# Discovery Engine Skill

Finds relevant people for outreach using Exa AI integration.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user:
- Wants to find people to reach out to based on criteria
- Searches for people by role, company, industry, or location
- Needs to research companies before outreach
- Wants to build a target list for campaigns

## When NOT to Use This Skill

Do NOT use this skill for:
- Sending messages → use `workflow-engine` or platform-specific skills
- Managing team → use `team-manager`
- Reading emails → use `inbox-reader`

## Capabilities

1. **People Search** - Find people using Exa AI LinkedIn search
2. **Company Research** - Research companies for targeting
3. **Profile Enrichment** - Cross-reference to find Twitter/Instagram
4. **Target Management** - Store and organize discovered people
5. **Export** - Export to JSON/CSV for campaigns

## Exa AI MCP Integration

This skill uses Exa AI MCP for intelligent search. The following Exa tools are available:

- `linkedin_search_exa` - Search LinkedIn for people
- `company_research_exa` - Research companies
- `web_search_exa` - General web search for profiles
- `deep_researcher_start/check` - Deep research on topics

**Note:** Ensure Exa AI MCP is configured in Claude Code settings.

## Discovery Workflow

### 1. Create Discovery Session

Before searching, create a session to track results:

```bash
python .claude/scripts/discovery_engine.py session --query "AI startup founders San Francisco" --source linkedin_search
```

### 2. Perform Exa AI Search

Use Exa AI MCP to search (this happens through Claude's MCP integration):

**Example prompt to Exa:**
"Search LinkedIn for AI startup founders in San Francisco who have raised Series A funding"

### 3. Process and Store Results

After receiving Exa results, add people to the session:

```python
# The discovery_engine.py processes Exa responses
# Results are stored in output/discovery/people.json
```

### 4. View Discovered People

```bash
python .claude/scripts/discovery_engine.py list --has-linkedin
```

### 5. Export for Campaign

```bash
python .claude/scripts/discovery_engine.py export --format csv --output output/discovery/targets.csv
```

## Commands Reference

### View Discovery Stats

```bash
python .claude/scripts/discovery_engine.py stats
```

### List Discovered People

```bash
# All people
python .claude/scripts/discovery_engine.py list

# Filter by criteria
python .claude/scripts/discovery_engine.py list --query "founder" --has-linkedin --status not_contacted
```

### Get Person Details

```bash
python .claude/scripts/discovery_engine.py get --id PERSON_ID
```

### Update Outreach Status

```bash
python .claude/scripts/discovery_engine.py status --id PERSON_ID --status contacted --notes "Sent LinkedIn connection"
```

### Export People

```bash
# JSON export
python .claude/scripts/discovery_engine.py export --format json --output output/targets.json

# CSV export
python .claude/scripts/discovery_engine.py export --format csv --output output/targets.csv
```

## Example Discovery Workflow

**User:** "Find 10 DevOps engineers at Series B startups in Austin"

**Assistant Workflow:**

1. **Use TodoWrite to track:**
   ```json
   [
     {"content": "Create discovery session", "status": "in_progress"},
     {"content": "Search using Exa AI", "status": "pending"},
     {"content": "Process and store results", "status": "pending"},
     {"content": "Show discovered people", "status": "pending"}
   ]
   ```

2. **Create session:**
   ```bash
   python .claude/scripts/discovery_engine.py session --query "DevOps engineers Series B startups Austin" --source linkedin_search
   ```

3. **Search with Exa AI:**
   Use WebSearch or Exa MCP:
   "Search LinkedIn for DevOps engineers at Series B funded startups in Austin, Texas"

4. **Process results:**
   Parse Exa response and add people to discovery session.

5. **Show summary:**
   ```
   Found 10 DevOps engineers:

   1. John Smith - Senior DevOps at TechCo
      LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/johnsmith
      Twitter: @john_devops

   2. Jane Doe - Platform Engineer at StartupX
      LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/janedoe
      ...
   ```

6. **Ask user:**
   "Would you like to add these 10 people to a workflow for outreach?"

## Data Storage

Discovery data is stored in:
- `output/discovery/sessions.json` - Search sessions
- `output/discovery/people.json` - All discovered people

## Search Best Practices

1. **Be Specific:** "AI startup founders Series A San Francisco" > "startup founders"
2. **Include Location:** Helps narrow results
3. **Add Context:** Role + Industry + Company stage
4. **Use Tags:** Tag people for easy filtering later

## Enrichment

After initial discovery, you can enrich profiles:

1. **Find Twitter:** Search web for "[Name] [Company] twitter"
2. **Find Email:** Look for public email on LinkedIn or company site
3. **Company Research:** Use `company_research_exa` for company context

The discovery engine automatically deduplicates and merges enriched data.
