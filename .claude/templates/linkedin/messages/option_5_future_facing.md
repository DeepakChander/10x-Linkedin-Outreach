# Option 5 — Future-Facing (Founders scaling small companies)

Hi {{first_name}},

What you're building at {{company}} is exactly the kind of company that's about to hit an inflection point. {{specific_insight}} tells me you're thinking about this the right way.

The founders who are winning right now aren't waiting for AI to be "ready" — they're building with it today. We've helped dozens of companies at your stage 10x their output without 10x-ing their team.

Would love to show you what that looks like. 15 minutes?
